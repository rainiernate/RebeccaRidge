# Data Filtering Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Found
- **Property:** 15807 131st Ave (2,688 sq ft, $213,000, sold 2005)
- **Problem:** Showed up in analysis despite being outside 1100-1900 sq ft range
- **Root Cause:** Data files weren't actually pre-filtered as filenames suggested

## ✅ Fix Applied
- **Added proper filtering** in `data_preprocessing.py`
- **Applied 1100-1900 sq ft filter** during data loading
- **Removed outliers** that don't match target size range

## 📊 Results
- **Rebecca Ridge:** Filtered out 16 properties (150 remaining)
- **Sunrise Area:** Filtered out 50 properties (529 remaining)
- **Verified:** 15807 131st properly excluded from both datasets
- **Range confirmed:** All properties now within 1100-1900 sq ft

## 🔧 Technical Changes
1. Modified `load_and_preprocess_data()` function
2. Added explicit square footage filtering: `(df_sold['Finished Sqft'] >= 1100) & (df_sold['Finished Sqft'] <= 1900)`
3. Added logging to show how many properties were filtered out
4. Updated dataset descriptions to reflect "filtered" data

## ✨ Impact
- **More accurate comparisons** between Rebecca Ridge and Sunrise Area
- **Consistent data scope** across both datasets  
- **Better client insights** based on truly comparable properties
- **No more data leakage** from properties outside target range
